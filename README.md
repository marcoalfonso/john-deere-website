# RDO Equipment Australia

## Getting started

Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (if you haven't already).

$ yarn install
```

### Set up of the needed content model and create a configuration file

This project comes with a Contentful setup command `yarn run setup`.

![Command line dialog of the yarn run setup command](https://rawgit.com/contentful-userland/gatsby-contentful-starter/master/setup.jpg "Command line dialog of the yarn run setup command")

This command will ask you for a space ID, and access tokens for the Contentful Management and Delivery API and then import the needed content model into the space you define and write a config file (`./contentful.json`).

`yarn run setup` automates that for you but if you want to do it yourself rename `.contentful.json.sample` to `.contentful.json` and add your configuration in this file.
